## Install globally

This package requires `node >= 10`.

```bash
npm install -g @21epub/create-parcel-react-library
```

## Usage with npx

```bash
npx @21epub/create-parcel-react-library
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

## Creating a New Module

```bash
create-parcel-react-library
```

Answer some basic prompts about your module, and then the CLI will perform the following steps:

- copy over the template
- install dependencies via yarn or npm
- install peers vis yarn or npm (You have to do this since peers will not auto installed , dev start will cause error !)
- initialize local git repo

At this point, your new module is ready and is all setup for local development.

## Development

There's only one thing to do your development is enjoy your coding in `src/` and your example in `example/`

```bash
npm start # start your example dev code  
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or `example/` will live-reload your parcel dev so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

#### Publishing to npm

```bash
npm run release # Version and changelog
git push --follow-tags origin master
npm publish
```

This builds `commonjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.

Make sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.
